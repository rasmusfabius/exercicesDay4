                  - All the answers must be in JavaScript
                  - The solution must be pushed to the repository and be available for the tutors by the end of the day
                  - You can ask for tutor's help
                  - You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material provided
                  - Load the HTML into your fav browser and call the function by name (es.: area(12, 23))
